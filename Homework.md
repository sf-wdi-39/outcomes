# Outcomes Homework

- Homework will follow the exact same requirements and format as your in-class homework. You will always have competing pressure to complete outcomes work or your classwork. Manage your time effectively.

- Turn in **something**. Turning in an incomplete assignment is **infinitely** better than turning in nothing at all. I can't get you the help you need unless we see what you're working on. That said...

- **Late homework will not be accepted**. If you have issues submitting homework please let me know.


## Due Dates and Grading

- You will be assigned homework almost every week. Outcomes HW is due every Monday at 6 pm. 

- You will receive feedback on *some* of your homework assignments. Each homework details if you will receive feedback and when. I will always check that it's completed. If you have any questions about your work or want additional feedback, please set up a 1:1 with me. 

- **I rely on homework to know where you're at.** It's very much to your advantage to turn in your homework the day it's assigned, even if -- *especially* if -- you're not able to finish it. Then we can address concerns and keep you from falling behind. I provide this flexibility to account for extenuating circumstances.
