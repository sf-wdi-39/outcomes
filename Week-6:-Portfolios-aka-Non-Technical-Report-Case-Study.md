## Learning Objectives:

* Understand best practices for Case Studies(aka portfolios) 


## Agenda:


* Overview of Case Study Best Practices 
* Panel: 
    * [Michael Schultze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-schulze-8577b33b/)
    * [Sarah (Slattery) Siedlecki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahslattery/)

## Steps to Creating an effective Case Study:

STEP 1: RECOGNIZE YOUR AUDIENCE						
Your portfolio should show your ability to present to both technical and non-technical audiences 

## Non-technical
Be able to describe:
 * the problem you were trying to solve
 * methods you used
results in a conclusion; use visuals.

## Technical 
Describe the problem:
 * process and methods
 * explain why your approach was appropriate
 * include code
 * conclusion and takeaways
						
Step 2: Describe the problem you are trying to solve and any hypotheses (this portion can be slightly more for non-technical audiences)
						
Step 3: 
* Describe your process and methods (this portion is slightly more for a technical audience)
* Merging/loading the data 
* Understanding the state of the data 
* Assessing the quality - data munging EDA - Exploratory 
* Data Analysis 
* Formulate a plan to model					
* State your intention clearly and explain your rationale and why you are choosing a specific model and how you plan to choose your variables.
* [If it's part of your project, include any predictive models you're building. Explain what it predicts and what it's intended to show.]
* Build the model and show your code.
* You may build several models. Explain the pros and cons and tradeoffs to each one			Explain and visualize your results - show results from the models you built Conclusion (can be also for non technical audience)
* What you did you discover?						
* Did you have a hypothesis? Was it true or not? Were you able to show it? How can you use the information you discovered?
[If you made a prediction, validate how it will be useful.]
 



## Dos:
* Do include blocks of code
* Do include comments explaining your models and explaining each block of code
* Do use visuals
* Do remember you are telling a story. Channel your inner detective and walk the listener through your story with the data.


## Dont's:
* Don't go down rabbit holes with the information. Be clear and concise and informative and know your audience.
* Don't just try everything with the data and walk the reader through all the trial and errors. Show your critical thinking skills!
